## Self-Reflection:

- **How long it took me to finish this?**
<!-- Answer below this line -->
I'm getting better with time. This took me over one hour, as I reviewed the notes and videos before attempting to complete this assignment.

<!-- Answer below this line -->
"It's perfect to me. The effort I put in paid off really well."

- **In hindsight, what would you do differently?**
- <!-- Answer below this line -->
I will definitely start the assignment in class and see if I have any questions. I always wait until I get home to use my Windows computer to start because it's bigger. I can have the instructions tab open and Visual Studio Code open.
